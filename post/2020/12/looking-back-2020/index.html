<i class="fas fa-user"></i>&nbsp;Jan Reggie Dela Cruz
- <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>&nbsp;~12 Minutes</h6><div class=card-text><p>It is no doubt that 2020 has been quite a challenging year for all of us,
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">current world events
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> aside.
Nonetheless, it is not all gloom,
and in this post I look back at several achievements and projects that I have done in the past several months.</p><h2 id=foreword>Foreword</h2><p>Yes, I am quite aware that the pandemic has brought us immense damage.
This is not the scope of this post.
Rather, I would like to highlight how this year has given me ample opportunity to improve myself
despite what has been happening around me.</p><h2 id=some-achievements>Some Achievements</h2><h3 id=thesis-and-completing-my-undergraduate-degree>Thesis and completing my undergraduate degree</h3><figure class=optfigure><img src=https://janreggie.github.io/post/2020/12/looking-back-2020/feature-grad-photo.jpg class="mx-auto d-block" width=1280 height=720 alt="A photo of the author in Animal Crossing with his graduation gear"><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><p>This doesn&rsquo;t have the same energy as me marching in front of a stage in graduation day,
but this will do.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For the majority of undergraduate students,
the final hurdle of their academic lives is the Thesis™️,
a year-long (or semester-long) project that aims to showcase one&rsquo;s mastery of their field.
And it was a journey indeed.</p><p>The project was ultimately going to be about using neural nets
to interpret videos of sign language
and extract features to determine what sign a video was supposed to represent.
Originally, as optimistic college students,
my partner and I were supposed to have a complete implementation,
having a separate Android app for it to place in front of someone
so that the hand motion can be interpreted in real time.</p><p>Unfortunately, we seemed to have been overconfident
in regards to how much our project will become.
We had to reduce our project scope to &ldquo;make sure the neural nets work with videos online&rdquo;
and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bother with Android, just make sure Tensorflow can crunch the data well&rdquo;,
and even then we kinda flopped.
We only managed to squeeze out an abyssmal 8% accuracy rate,
even at a small vocabulary of four words,
and that might even drop to zero if we were to test it
with videos that weren&rsquo;t made by the same producers.</p><p>Because of the seemingly ongoing threat of the pandemic at the time,
and the pressure that it has been imposing among students,
our university has decided to give all of its students passing marks.
Hence, we &ldquo;passed&rdquo; our thesis even if its goals weren&rsquo;t achieved.
We only had to document everything that we have done,
the literature behind the project,
and our recommendations for future authors.
That wasn&rsquo;t the most honorable way of passing,
but it is indescribable how much weight has been lifted from me
due to that &ldquo;universal pass&rdquo; doctrine.</p><p>We might have not made our thesis work,
but it was nonetheless a learning experience for the both of us.
At least we learned how neural nets operate,
but not enough for us to operate on them effectively.</p><p>As much as I would love to talk about other &ldquo;war stories&rdquo; during my time as an undergraduate,
such as pulling out at two all-nighters last year just for thesis,
that might be a bit out of scope for this sandbox for now.
Maybe some other time.</p><h3 id=an-awakening>An awakening</h3><p>We did it.
I got my degree.
Now what?</p><p>It was around May 2020 when I had the realization
that I had no clue what to do after getting my degree.
I could start looking for work, job postings, and whatever,
although it would be difficult because of current world events.</p><p>I realized that this is the perfect opportunity for me to explore learning topics
that I hadn&rsquo;t had the time otherwise because of curricular work.
Such topics I will be introducing in the following sections.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know what had awakened me.
Is it passion for me to become a better programmer and person?
Is it fear that I might end up as a NEET living with my parents?
No matter.
The seeds of self-improvement have been planted inside me.</p><p><a href=https://www.amazon.com/Defining-Decade-Your-Twenties-Matter/dp/0446561754 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Meg Jay&rsquo;s <em>The Defining Decade</em>

have been of great help with regards to my self-development and improvement.
I do recommend that readers check them out.</p><h3 id=diving-into-web-development>Diving into web development</h3><figure class=optfigure><img src=https://janreggie.github.io/post/2020/12/looking-back-2020/stalnks.png class="mx-auto d-block" width=2048 height=1536 alt="A screencap of my 'stalnks inc.' page"><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><p>I never thought that I would be doing web development during the pandemic.
Then again, I never thought that I would bear witness to <em>a</em> pandemic.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I have been very unfair towards JavaScript several times before,
believing that it was such a poorly written and designed language.
I&rsquo;m not wrong for doing so, but I confess that I haven&rsquo;t written a single line of JavaScript before,
so I had to at least try it out.
And the best way to do so is to learn a bit of web development.</p><p>I decided to use <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp&rsquo;s curriculum
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
</a>,
which has been quite a famous way to learn code for absolute beginners.
I guess I&rsquo;m more of a false beginner in this field:
I <em>think</em> I know HTML and CSS, but only to some extent.
freeCodeCamp has brought my knowledge to an acceptable level.</p><p>After learning basic (static non-interactive) web development,
I had to learn a bit of JavaScript.
It is, indeed, quite a weird language to use,
although there is something that made me fall in love with JS:
<code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>filter</code>.
I later learned that those are concepts found in functional programming.</p><p>Afterwards, I decided to go through my Front End Libraries certification,
although I have yet to finish it up to this day.
It did expose me to Bootstrap, SASS, React, and Redux,
tools which I don&rsquo;t think I <em>will</em> be using in the future,
but are useful to know nonetheless.</p><p>I also decided to take on the <a href=https://fullstackopen.com/en/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Stack Open 2020
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
</a>,
although just like my Front End cert, I didn&rsquo;t really go all in with it.
It might be because I fell out of love with web development,
but more importantly because I don&rsquo;t have enough time on my hands,
and I would like to go more into functional programming.
More on that later.</p><p>And, before ending this section,
JavaScript <em>is</em> a bad language.
Nonetheless, it is one of many tools that people can use for front-end web dev,
and it also happens to be the most famous one.
Kudos to all JavaScript developers,
and I&rsquo;m sorry for all the pain that all of you go through.</p><h3 id=the-sandbox-and-other-projects>The Sandbox and other projects</h3><figure class=optfigure><img src=https://janreggie.github.io/post/2020/12/looking-back-2020/aoc-2020.png class="mx-auto d-block" width=925 height=712 alt="A screencap of my Advent of Code tree for the year 2020"><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><p>Such a shame I didn&rsquo;t finish the entire tree in time.
Oh well, there is still next year.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I started the Sandbox around September 2020,
and while I would post less than I had expected,
it is still my way of practising and showing off my prose.
I hope that, in the near future, this Sandbox will be of good use to me.</p><p>Aside from that, I have also been doing other programming projects.
Several ones related to web development can be found on my <a href=https://codepen.io/janreggie target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">CodePen
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
and at my GitHub page.
Most of them are exercises for the certifications, though.</p><p>The project which I&rsquo;m most proud of is my progress for this year in the <a href=https://adventofcode.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Advent of Code
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
</a>.
They are a set of puzzles for each day of December, leading to Christmas.
It was quite a lot of fun, although at times I got stumped for too long
that the next challenge gets released while I was too busy solving the previous one.
I aim to be good enough at programming
to finish the 2021 series in time.</p><h3 id=courses-and-books>Courses and books</h3><figure class=optfigure><img src=https://janreggie.github.io/post/2020/12/looking-back-2020/satania-sicp.jpg class="mx-auto d-block" width=778 height=720 alt="Satania, a character from the series Gabriel DropOut, seen reading the book SICP with an unknown facial expression"><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><p>Is it long? Yes. Will it be worth it? Probably so.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I have taken on other courses and books online as well.
And while I have completed some of them,
unfortunately I have abandoned some half-way.</p><p><a href=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/algorithms-in-a/9780596516246/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Heineman, Pollice, and Selkow&rsquo;s <em>Algorithms in a Nutshell</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
is, indeed, a very useful resource in learning about algorithms.
It is also very dense and, if I may, boring.
I had to stop reading through it after learning about graphs
because just opening it has become a chore.</p><p><a href=https://www.manning.com/books/go-web-programming target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Chang&rsquo;s <em>Go Web Programming</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
is a great resource about using Go in writing web applications,
as well as learning a bit more about how web applications work in the backend.
I believe that I might be using it as a reference from time to time during my work.</p><p><a href=https://selectstarsql.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Kao&rsquo;s <em>Select Star SQL</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
is an online, interactive book that teaches SQL.
It is amazing because it gives the reader an intuition on how to write queries,
as well as the reader getting to use real world data:
death row inmates.</p><p>Speaking of SQL, I have already written about <a href=https://janreggie.github.io/post/2020/09/sql-murder-mystery/>the SQL Murder Mystery
</a>,
a mini game which invites the player to solve a murder mystery
by running SQL commands in a database.</p><p><a href=https://devopswithdocker.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">The University of Helsinki&rsquo;s <em>DevOps with Docker</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
is an MOOC designed to give an introduction to Docker
and how it can be used to ease development workflows.
I had to stop at the later parts of Part 3
since I believe that I know sufficient Docker to pick it up more easily later,
and because there might be something wrong with my computer:
it doesn&rsquo;t want to use Docker anymore.</p><p><a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas and Hunt&rsquo;s <em>Pragmatic Programmer</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
has always been a classic among programmers,
and the 20th Anniversary edition has been written to fit their ideas
into the modern world.
It is a book containing hints on how to improve the programmer&rsquo;s craft
in a very digestible form.
After the past 20 years since the first edition was written
the technologies that we use might have changed,
but the people who develop them have not.
I am still reading this book up to this day,
as it will prove useful to my work.</p><p>Speaking of classics,
<a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman&rsquo;s <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
is also a classic among more experienced programmers.
It aims to teach, or reteach, the fundamentals of computer programming,
starting from basic principles and building on top of these.
It is definitely not an easy book to digest,
but I took on the challenge.
Unfortunately, I will be shelving it for now,
but I will come back for it.
My (incomplete) solutions can be found on <a href=https://github.com/janreggie/sicp target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">janreggie/sicp

&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
is a free course on Udemy
which teaches how to use Vim.
I had to use it to be able to edit text in the Linux terminal,
and now I&rsquo;m kinda okay with Vim.
I have Vim mode whenever I use VS Code, for example.</p><h3 id=starting-my-career>Starting my career</h3><figure class=optfigure><img src=https://janreggie.github.io/post/2020/12/looking-back-2020/git-force-push.jpg class="mx-auto d-block" width=1080 height=712 alt='@codeinthehole says: "On your first day at the new job, squash every commit from the repo into a single commit with message "Legacy code" and force-push to master."'><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><p>Please don&rsquo;t do this.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Around mid-November, someone contacted me on LinkedIn
about a full-time opportunity for some place in Mandaluyong.
I said yes.
And two interviews and a month later, I&rsquo;m part of their organization.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t say much about what I do at work.
Not necessarily because there isn&rsquo;t much yet since I&rsquo;ve been just employed for 2 weeks,
but more importantly because I signed a non-disclosure agreement.
I can say, however, is that this looks like a wonderful way to start my programming career,
and I will forever be grateful to the one who introduced me to them.</p><p>As much as I would want to talk about my &ldquo;war stories&rdquo;
about the horrible interviews I have had,
I don&rsquo;t think here and now are the appropriate place and time to write them down.
Once again, maybe some other time.</p><h3 id=theres-more-to-life-than-programming>There&rsquo;s more to life than programming</h3><p>And there&rsquo;s definitely more to learn than programming,
although there isn&rsquo;t much that I could talk about,
nor there is anything to interest readers of these types of blogs.</p><p>I started exercising since mid-June,
and I have been continuing to do so until now.
It&rsquo;s not too impressive, rather just a few bodyweight exercises.
Nonetheless, physical exercise is helpful to one&rsquo;s physical and mental health.</p><p>I took a jab at learning how to draw.
I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy the experience, however.</p><p>I have been studying Japanese for almost a year since August 2019,
although I had to stop at June 2020
because it was already getting boring.
It felt like a chore,
and I don&rsquo;t think I have a reason why I would want to learn Japanese,
aside from maybe as an intellectual exercise.
It was a <em>frustrating</em> intellectual exercise with not much benefit, however.</p><p>I did begin learning Spanish since July 2020,
and I have been continuing to do up to this day.
The goal is to ultimately read Philippine Spanish literature,
although through the way I discovered several Spanish media
to keep me both motivated and interested in the language.</p><h2 id=looking-into-the-future>Looking into the Future</h2><p>I have planted the seeds of self-improvement this year.
The objective for next year is to tend to this garden of mine
and keeping it proper.
Of course, there is no way to predict what the future will hold,
but at the very least I get to</p><h3 id=seasons>Seasons</h3><p>Partly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">CGPGrey&rsquo;s <em>Your Theme</em>

</a>,
I am planning to incorporate &ldquo;themes&rdquo; for every season of the following year.
For instance, at Spring 2021,
I could focus more on my career by studying more about software engineering.</p><h3 id=focusing-on-career-stuff>Focusing on career stuff</h3><p>Speaking of career, this is what I meant a while ago.
I have been continuing reading <em>Pragmatic Programmer</em>,

&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
and <a href=https://www.spinellis.gr/codereading/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Spinellis&rsquo;s <em>Code Reading</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>
once I&rsquo;m done with that.</p><h3 id=more-functional-programming-maybe>More functional programming, maybe</h3><p>After finishing the Haskell MOOC,
I wanted to dive deeper by finishing <a href=https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/books/functional/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Bird&rsquo;s <em>Thinking Functionally with Haskell</em>
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>

&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
</a>.
Afterwards, maybe I&rsquo;ll go write some programs with this new language.
The <a href=https://projecteuler.net/archives target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Euler problems
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> look tempting&mldr;</p><h3 id=reviving-abandoned-projects>Reviving abandoned projects</h3><p>I have always wanted to continue the <em>Full Stack Open</em>,
as well as finally getting my freeCodeCamp &ldquo;Front End Web Development&rdquo; certificate.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll go through that at Autumn 2021.
Maybe not, though.
Who knows what the future will bring.</p><h2 id=my-heartfelt-thanks>My Heartfelt Thanks</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t think I could have made it through this year just by myself.
I wish to thank all the people whom I have had the chance to talk to,
especially during the quarantine,
as, to be honest, things do get lonely sometimes.
I also wish to thank everyone whom have helped me get to this point,
especially those whom have recommended me places to work at and apply to.</p><p>I am excited what the following year will bring me,
or rather, where I will take it.</p><p>May the following year be auspicious for everyone.
Or that is what we hope 😔✊</p></div></div><div class=card-footer><small class=text-muted><i class="fas fa-folder text-primary"></i>&nbsp;
