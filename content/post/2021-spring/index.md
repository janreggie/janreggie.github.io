Spring 2021: :dart: Focus will be a season about focusing on my career,
which means having to put aside personal projects
in exchange for learning skills that will help me in the workplace.

<!--more-->

This is the first post of the `season` series,
where I try to talk about my expectations and experiences every "season",
that is, a period of 2~4 months with an overarching "theme".

## Objectives

The future is difficult to predict,
and it is possible that I fail to commit any or all of the following objectives.
Nonetheless, I hope that writing down my goals will guide me to the right direction.

### Read literature related to the field

I have finished reading [*The Pragmatic Programmer*](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)
and I hope to apply the knowledge presented in my day job.
I'm currently reading Shvets's [*Dive into Design Patterns*](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book),
which is an excellent rehashing of the GoF book with easier to understand visuals and metaphors.
I have also been reading Brooks's [*The Mythical Man-Month*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
containing essays of what software engineering was like in the 1970s,
which while might not serve much practical purpose today
is still a pleasant and leisurely read.

There is so much literature in software engineering and development
and I am excited to see what these books have to offer.
[*Code Complete*](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) comes into mind,
although I might encounter other similar books.

### Put aside personal projects

I have always wanted to continue learning Haskell,
or complete and refactor the Advent of Code series,
although now would not be the time for those.
Next season might be a more appropriate time for it.

### Cut down on studying Spanish

I have been studying the language for eight months.
I don't think that I need to spend 8 hours a week on formally studying it any longer,
and instead focus on exposing myself to literature more and more.

Since a year and a half ago, language learning has always been a part of my routine,
but I have to be more comfortable in using the language more than learning it.
I will most likely cull the hours per week to between 4 and 6.

As of the moment, my way of studying is reading through Prisma,
which is an excellent book in the classroom, although might not work for my case.
I might have to introduce other methods, and catalog my whole journey in a separate article.

### Reflect by the end, and continue having themes by next season

At the end of Spring 2021, I will come back to this post
and talk about my experiences for the past three or four months.
I will also be doing what I've done here for Summer 2021.

The purpose of these seasons is to have some "theme" to guide my decisions.
These objectives are more concrete goalposts based on this theme.

I am thinking of having next season as :canoe: Explore,
and I'll let you know why by then.
