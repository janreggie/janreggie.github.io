description: "About janreggie's sandbox, and why I made this website"
---

Hello, and welcome to this website.
I don't know what got you here, but you're always welcome to check around the posts that I've written.

## Why the sandbox

Why do people write blogs in the first place?
A reason could be wanting to show the world what they're capable of writing.
Another reason could be wanting to hone their writing skills.
There's definitely more reasons that I wouldn't want to go on here,
and [Fishbin from the *Huffington Post* writes ten reasons to do so](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-reasons-you-should-sta_b_5326353).

Personally I wanted to put all of my work in a single place.
Well, my Github profile already does that for me,
although I wanted to talk more about these projects
without having to dedicate an entire `gh-pages` site for each of them.
I also wanted to have an outlet to put the things I've done,
for instance, after reading a recent book or finishing an online course.

There's also the appeal of having an online presence to improve one's job prospects.
I could say that I have been swayed by that.

## Why the technology

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I believe, is a good enough:tm: technology for hosting a website such as this one.
A software development platform sounds like the perfect place to host content pertaining mostly to software development.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is also a good enough:tm: technology for static website building.
It allows me to build a website with little configuration and lets me focus on writing content.
I'm also more used to using it and Go templates instead of, say, Jekyll,
which I have not tried at all, although I do hear good things about the latter.

I have also decided to release the content of this site under [CC BY 4.0]({{< relref "/license" >}}),
so that other people who might want to use the information I wrote for some purpose
only need to credit me and the permalink.

I will put the more technical discussion of this website,
such as configuration and details on modifying the theme in Hugo,
in [janreggie.github.io: internals of janreggie's sandbox]({{/* < relref "/project/janreggie.github.io/index.md" > */}}).
<!-- Apparently without the "md", it thinks the file ends in "io". -->

## My regards

and his [bootstrap-bp-hugo-theme](https://github.com/spech66/bootstrap-bp-hugo-theme/).
